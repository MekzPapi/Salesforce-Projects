Problem Statement:
The Finance Head of Global Communications has asked you to create an application to calculate mobile and internet bills for their customers. Currently, the company maintains their customer data in an Excel sheet. As the number of customers has reached 3,000, maintaining this data in an Excel sheet has become nearly impossible. This app that you need to develop should be able to calculate the customersâ€™ bills based on their usage and rental plan as well as generate reports and dashboards for management and stakeholders. 

Analysis:

First, analyze the problem: 

The company offers telecommunication services to mobile and internet users. Consequently, the application to be designed needs to store customer information, rental plan, Order, Invoice, Payment, Bill and Bill item details. All this information needs to be created/stored in Salesforce Objects where the following can be saved: 




Customer information such as First Name, Last Name, phone, and Address including State, City and email. 
Plan details such as usage, rate of calls, SMS and Internet e.t.c
Billing information contains the total number of calls made, the total number of messages sent, and the total amount of internet data used 
Billing Item details that contain details of the bills for calls made, messages sent and internet used. 
Order contains order information for a new customer. It should have the order number, plan, customer details, estimated monthly payment e.t.c
Invoice contains information about particular order information. It should have the details of the order, the amount to pay and any relevant fields for the invoice e.t.c
Payment contains all the payments made by a customer. Should be dated i.e. payment date, the amount paid and month/duration of the payment period.
